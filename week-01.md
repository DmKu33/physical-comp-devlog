1\. Follow the [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47#slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47) to create a functioning circuit on Tinkercad and link to it here.

- [My Tinkercad circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0CnshvlTdqg/editel?sharecode=ct8TKjyhwtT65QmzuHx6ZtMSgSZSnujaB5BlxbSkTmM)



2\. Share your maths using Ohm's law to find the resistor value for your Tinkercad circuit.

- Ohm's Law: R = (Vs - Vf) / If. Supply voltage is 9V, LED forward voltage is 2V, desired current is 20mA (0.02A). So: (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = **350**.



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 01 - A People's History of Electronic Music (2-14) and Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (15-up to 38) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences)

- "Almost everything that came after that — the nature of space, light, general and special relativity, and basically all modern communication and electronic technology as we know it — starts with that twitching compass demo." It's a great reminder that transformative discoveries often look like minor curiosities at first, and we shouldn't disregard even the simplest patterns we notice — they may become future breakthroughs.



4\. Explore Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music 2.0 https://music.ishkur.com/ referenced by Pearson. Describe the influence of one genre from this guide on your current musical listening habits. `(2-3 sentences)`

- Synthwave caught my attention immediately — I've been going through dark synthwave playlists while studying, and already knowing its 80s analog roots is part of why it sometimes feels so distinct and intentional to me.



5\. 🎬 Watch this introduction to [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 1: Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ) (15:33). Describe one of Robert Moog's contributions to electronic music.

- Moog's biggest contribution was making the synthesizer actually playable. He introduced voltage-controlled oscillators and a keyboard interface. He basically turned what was essentially lab equipment into a musical instrument that musicians could perform with expressively in real time.

6\. The Moog video references ideas also presented in Pearson's "Speaker as microphone" experiment (p.37) explain what a microphone, a speaker, and the human ear have in common? (2-3 sentences)

- All three convert between mechanical vibration and electrical signal (or vice versa) using a membrane — a speaker pushes air to create sound, a microphone captures those pressure waves and turns them back into electricity, and the eardrum does essentially the same thing biologically. They're all working under the same physical pinciples, just with different directions.


7\. 🎬 Explore cinematic scores and other works created by [Wendy Carlos](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+carlos+filmography) using a Moog. Paste a link to an online example and describe what you like about the composition, performance, connection to themes in the film, etc. (2-3 sentences)

- [Wendy Carlos - The Shining Main Title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiV3J_e977Q) — what gets me is how she uses the Moog to make something that sounds neither fully orchestral nor fully electronic. Before realizing how this was created, I always it's the sound of some modified trombone as part of instruments. It perfect fits the movie with its theme of isolationism and madness.

- Tried building the circuit from the Tinkercad setup in real life - LED didn't light up. Turned out it was burnt. Replaced it and everything worked fine.



## Questions to bring up in class
